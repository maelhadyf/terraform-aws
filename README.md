## Terraform AWS Setup: Nginx Web Server

This Terraform script sets up a basic AWS infrastructure to deploy a web server running Nginx. Below is a breakdown of the resources and configurations defined in the code:

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have completed the following steps:

#### 1. **Install Terraform**

#### 2. **Ensure that the AWS CLI is installed and configured with your AWS credentials**

#### 3. **Create an SSH Key Pair**

---

## How to Run the Script

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maelhadyf/terraform-aws.git
cd terraform-aws-nginx
```
#### 2. Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```
#### 3. Run Terraform Plan to see what changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure
```bash
terraform plan
```
#### 4. Apply the Terraform Configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```
## Take Care
#### Cleanup (To destroy the resources created by this Terraform configuration)
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Code Explanation

#### 1. AWS Provider Configuration
- Specifies AWS as the cloud provider.
- Sets the region to `us-east-1`.

#### 2. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Creates a VPC with CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`.
- Enables DNS support and DNS hostnames.
- Tags the VPC with the name `"main-vpc"`.

#### 3. Public Subnet
- Creates a public subnet with CIDR block `10.0.1.0/24` in the availability zone `us-east-1a`.
- Configures the subnet to automatically assign public IP addresses to instances launched in it.
- Tags the subnet with the name `"public-subnet"`.

#### 4. Internet Gateway
- Creates an internet gateway and attaches it to the VPC.
- Tags the gateway with the name `"internet-gateway"`.

#### 5. Route Table (Public Route Table)
- Defines a route table for the VPC with a route to the internet (`0.0.0.0/0`) via the internet gateway.

#### 6. Route Table Association
- Associates the public subnet with the public route table, allowing instances in the subnet to access the internet.

#### 7. Security Group (Allow Nginx)
- Creates a security group allowing inbound HTTP traffic (port 80) from any IP address (`0.0.0.0/0`).
- Allows all outbound traffic.
- Tags the security group with the name `"allow-nginx"`.

#### 8. EC2 Instance (Nginx Web Server)
- Launches an EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2 AMI (`ami-063d43db0594b521b`) and instance type `t2.micro`.
- Places the instance in the public subnet with the `allow-nginx` security group.
- The instance is assigned a public IP address.
- Uses a `user_data` script to install and start Nginx, set up a "Hello World Terraform" page, and restart Nginx.
- Tags the instance with the name `"nginx-server"`.

#### 9. Output
- Outputs the public IP address of the created EC2 instance (`web_public_ip`).

---

## Summary:
This Terraform script automates the creation of a simple web server infrastructure in AWS, including a VPC, public subnet, internet gateway, security group, and an EC2 instance running Nginx. The EC2 instance serves a static "Hello World" page, accessible via HTTP from the internet.
